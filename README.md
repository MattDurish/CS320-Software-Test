# CS320-Software-Test
To ensure that the software is functional, testing should be performed against the code for meeting software requirements from the client and all results that can occur are expected. Security of the program comes from attempting to handle as many common vulnerabilities as possible while still achieving the required functionality. Performing JUnit tests is one of many approaches for ensuring functionality and security. This project had already interpretted user needs in a detailed manner, however, I would use this interpretation as a framework for communicating to the developer on how to design the program and meet the client's expectations. The needs were interpreted via data validation concepts like no null inputs and character restrictions, and I believe asking open ended questions to the client is the best approach to understand needs for a program.
